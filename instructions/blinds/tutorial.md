How to set up the RC car on the blinds
======================================

**1.** Unscrew (or detach in whatever fashion your RC car uses) your battery compartment cover. Make sure there are no batteries already in the car. Get two AA batteries handy.

**2.** Solder wires onto the end contacts (these are the ones on the end of the "battery chain" that would wire up the batteries in series, so they should be isolated and would only be connected to one end of one battery, if there were batteries in the car.) I made a picture and put it below for clarification.

**3.** Put in the 2 AA batteries you got out earlier in on the ends of the compartment so that you reinforce the connections you just soldered.

**4.** Grab one of your USB cords and, if you haven't already, cut off the plastic insulation and strip the red and black wires, as shown in the diagram below. Virtually all USB cables have this universal color-coding syntax, so don't worry:

**5.** Attach the red (positive) wire to the positive contact (the one without a spring, and the one with a plus sign next to it on the earlier diagram)'s wire and the black (negative) wire to the negative contact (logically, the one with a spring and with a minus sign next to it on the diagram)'s wire.

**6.** *INDIVIDUALLY* tape each connection and then wrap tape around from where the connections to the USB cable are to where the USB cable was first opened up. (The last bit is just for aesthetics, so you can skip it if you want. Make sure you do the first bit though, as that is needed for insulating the wires.

**7.** Get out one of your wall-to-USB converters and plug in your newly USB'ed car. If possible, you could do improvements such as drilling a hole in the battery compartment, detaching the wires, running them through, reattaching them, and screwing the battery compartment back on.

**8.** Keep your car on its back and try using its remote control to spin the wheels and steer it. If it works, congratulations! If it doesn't, go back and check every connection. Chances are one had disconnected.

**9.** One optional, but recommended, thing to do is to try and remove whatever extraneous plastic the manufacturer put on the car. For mine, that meant removing a giant plastic shell and a front bumper off of the car, which did make it look pretty awesome, but it had to go in order for me to safely put it on my wall. (I kept it- and turned it into a hat. :) )

**10.** Take the right back wheel and attach it to the spinny thing that changes how visible the outside past the blinds is by rotating the blinds (sadly, it appears no term exists to describe it). For my car, and I assume for many others, you can just slide in the rod like this:

If that won't work for you, use duct tape (or pretty much any other sort of adhesive) to make the rod stay attached to the wheel. (This joint needs to be pretty strong in order to hold up to the torque exerted on it, so don't do so sparingly.)

**11.** Use duct tape to stick the car onto the wall in a sort of "harness". You can then use the screws to make sure the harness will stay in. I also used staples and a few washers, but those are a little unnecessary.
