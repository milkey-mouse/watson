How to configure the Weather API
================================

**1.** Run the program located here: "watson/tools/wunderground-api/WundergroundSignup.exe". Enter your information and wait for it to finish.

**2.** Open Notepad (2, ++, vanilla, or whatever) and paste the API key that should have been generated. Save this somewhere (it doesn't matter where or what it's named, just that you can find it later).

**3.** Do the tutorial on TastyPrint next.
